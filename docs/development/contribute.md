##Coding
[RuneUI](http://www.runeaudio.com/about/#runeui "RuneUI") is the default UI of RuneAudio. Due to its nature (web interface) it's platform agnostic and responsive, and can be used from any device capable of running a modern web browser.

RuneUI is developed in **PHP** (backend) and **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript** (frontend).
