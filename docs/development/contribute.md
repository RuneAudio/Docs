##Coding
[RuneUI](http://www.runeaudio.com/about/#runeui "RuneUI") is the default UI of RuneAudio. Due to its nature (web interface) it is platform agnostic and responsive, and can be used from any device capable of running a modern web browser.

RuneUI is developed in **PHP** (backend) and **HTML**, **CSS** and **Javascript** (frontend).

##OS Maintenance
[RuneOS](http://www.runeaudio.com/about/#runeos "RuneOS") is a customized and optimized build of the [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) distro, specifically tailored around the scope of best sound quality achievement. The system continuously needs to be updated and ported to all the [certified platforms](http://www.runeaudio.com/certified-devices/ "Certified platforms").
