# RuneUI

## Introduction to the RuneUI

RuneAudio features **RuneUI**, a unique integrated and easy to use interface.

##### A web interface

Built in PHP, JavaScript and CSS. Due to its nature it’s **platform independent**, being accessible from every modern web browser, on every operating system.

##### A MPD client

Allowing the user to control the playback, browse the music database, manage playlists and edit the play queue.

##### A control panel

System configurations can be tweaked to obtain the best audio performance. It grants access to a number of system commands, without the need to open a terminal session.

It is **designed to be responsive**, and it displays correctly, scaling itself for every kind of device, including: desktop PCs, laptops, netbooks, tablets and smartphones.
